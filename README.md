# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ravi

Java backend developer passionate about building clean, scalable REST APIs.

🛠️ I work mainly with Java 21, Spring Boot 3, JPA & Hibernate.  
Currently enhancing my projects with JWT security, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Flyway migrations, and Spring Boot Actuator for observability.

📚 Always learning — exploring caching, distributed system patterns, and system design.

🚀 Check out my featured project: Spring Boot Task Tracker API, a fully authenticated REST API built with Spring Boot 3, JPA, JWT security, and Swagger docs.
